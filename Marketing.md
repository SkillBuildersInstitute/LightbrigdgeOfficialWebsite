 **Problem-Solving Post Series** (Weekly rotation)

POST 1 - Pain Point:
"Spending hours on spreadsheets that break when you need them most? 
There's a better way. With 15 years teaching database programming, 
I can transform your chaos into a system that actually works.
Let's build it together. DM for details."

POST 2 - Story/Testimonial:
"A local business owner came to me with a 'simple' project idea. 
After our discovery session, we uncovered 5 hidden requirements 
that would have caused major headaches later. That's the difference 
30 years of experience makes. [Link to full packet]"

POST 3 - Educational:
"🎓 DID YOU KNOW? Most software projects fail because developers 
build what you ASK for, not what you NEED. My teaching background 
means I ask the questions that uncover your real requirements. 
Ready to do software development the right way?"

"Supporting [Your City] businesses with software that actually solves 
problems. Entrepreneur since 1998, I understand what local business 
owners need. Let's grab coffee and talk about your challenges."

 💡 PRO TIPS

✅ **Start Small & Consistent** - Better to post 2x per week reliably than 10x one week and nothing for a month

✅ **Local First** - Focus on your geographic community before expanding online

✅ **Show, Don’t Tell** - Share what you’re working on (with permission), not just that you’re available

✅ **Educational > Sales** - Lead with helping, not selling

✅ **Leverage Your Teaching** - Your ability to explain is your superpower—use it everywhere

✅ **Follow Up** - Most business comes from the 3rd, 4th, 5th touchpoint, not the first

✅ **Document Everything** - Turn every project into a case study, every challenge into a blog post

✅ **Ask for Referrals** - Happy clients are your best marketing—make it easy for them to refer you

-----

**Remember:** Your unique combination of technical depth, teaching ability, and business experience is rare. The marketing is just about getting that message in front of people who need it.

**Start with what feels comfortable, then expand from there. You’ve got this! 🚀**
